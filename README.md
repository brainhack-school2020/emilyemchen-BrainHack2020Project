## Summary 

TODO: What is this project about? 

### Key Words
brainhack-school, project, machine-learning, eeg

## Project definition 

### Background

Hello! I am an (incoming) fourth year undergraduate student at McGill University studying computer science and urban health geography with a minor in cognitive science. I am a research assistant with [Isabelle Arseneau-Bruneau](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/ArsIsabelle_BHS_Project) in the Zatorre Lab and have been learning a lot about neuroscience research while (hopefully) lending some of my technical skills to Isabelle's PhD work exploring the effect of musical training on FFR. I joined the BrainHack School to learn technical research methods (e.g. machine learning) and work with neuroscience data. My main goal for the project I end up working on, whether it's my own or a collaboration with someone else (I am very open to working with others!), is to gain a strong grasp of machine learning, try out containerization, and use appropriate softwares and project organization to ensure reproducibility.  

### Tools 

This project will rely on the following technologies: 
* Python
* nilearn/scikit-learn 
* Git/Github
* Visual Studio Code
* Terminal 
* Jupyter notebook
* Visualization packages (matplotlib, plotly)
* Docker (maybe)

### Data 

TODO: What data will I be using? 

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, I will have the following:
* README.md file 
* requirements.txt file outline the packages needed to run the script
* Jupyter notebook with code that implements a machine learning algorithm, as well as explanations and processes 
* GitHub repository with all project components 
* Presentation showing project results

## Conclusion and acknowledgement

Thank you to the BrainHack School team for their help and for providing many resources throughout Weeks 1 and 2! I would like to acknowledge my mentor, [Désirée Lussier](https://github.com/dllussier), for her guidance in Week 2. Thank you also to [Andréanne Proulx](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/anproulx-fMRI-autism), [Liz Izakson](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/lizizakson_commonalitiesAcrossDomains), and [Mikkel Schöttner](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/mschoettner_fMRI-ML) for their peer help and for raising helpful issues on this project proposal. Lastly, thank you to [David MacDonald](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/dnmacdon_ASD_multisite_smri), [Hannah Kiesow](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/hannahkiesow_bhs_project), and [Elise Douard](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/BLUP_Brainhack-Learning-Unicorn-Project) for sharing their project ideas with me.
